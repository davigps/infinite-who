## About <a name = "about"></a>

Infinite Who (inspired by the game ["20 Questions"](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3377/20-questions)) is a project for those who like to use their imagination to guess the character/place/thing of a card.
The name infinite comes from the fact that the game is infinite, as the cards are generated automatically by the AI.

Compete with your friends to see who can guess the most cards!
In Solo mode, the game should have two rankings:
- Weekly ranking: based on the number of cards guessed in a week
- All time ranking: based on the number of cards guessed in the whole game

In Multiplayer mode, the game should have a board to compete with your friends.
